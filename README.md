# Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project explores the correlation between air quality and public health across different regions in the United States. Our aim is to identify specific air pollutants that significantly impact public health and to discover if certain populations are more affected by poor air quality than others.

CSP 571 - Data Preparation & Analysis, Spring 2024

## Objectives
- To analyze the effect of air quality on public health in various US regions.
- To identify the air pollutants most strongly correlated with adverse health outcomes.
- To determine if certain demographics are disproportionately affected by air quality issues.

## Methodology
Our approach involves aggregating air quality data from EPA databases and health outcome data from health departments. We'll employ clustering algorithms to group regions based on air quality parameters and demographic characteristics, and apply statistical methods to assess health outcomes.

## Data Sources
- **EPA Air Quality System (AQS):** Provides spatial and time-series data on pollutant concentrations.
- **CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS):** Offers data on health outcomes and demographic information.

## Tools and Technologies
- **R and RStudio:** For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- Packages such as `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `sf`, `raster`, `caret`, and `glmnet` among others.
